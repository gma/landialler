TODO
----

Prioritised list of things to do:

  - Drop gmalib (done).

  - Re-write server with unit test coverage (in progress).

  - Port XML-RPC code to later versions of Python (in progress).

  - Re-implement the current client in GTK2 only, drop Tk (in progress).

  - Replace Tk support with alternative Windows capable client (maybe GTK2?).

  - Add logging support to server via Python's logging API.

  - Replace server's Makefile with distutils. Maybe.

  - Display how long the server has been online (done).

  - Add support to the client for detecting time outs, allowing the
    client to retry the connection from scratch, with a retry/cancel
    dialog. Should this really go in the server and API?

  - Improve support for trapping common errors (e.g. missing
    config files aren't trapped properly yet).
