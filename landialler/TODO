TODO
----

Prioritised list of things to do:

  - Unit test coverage.

  - Support for more GUI toolkits (anygui, GTK2, QT).

  - Write a Java client.

  - Display how long the server has been online.

  - Display bytes sent/received (total and per client).

  - Put retry/cancel buttons on the dropped connection dialog.

  - Add support to the client for detecting time outs, allowing the
    client to retry the connection from scratch, with a retry/cancel
    dialog. Should this really go in the server and API?

  - Improve support for trapping common errors (e.g. missing
    config files aren't trapped properly yet).
