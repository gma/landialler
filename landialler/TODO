TODO

This file documents upcoming fixes/things on my mind/stuff I'd like to
do, in no particular order.

  - Add a thread to the server to keep better track of the number of
    current users, so that the server can close the connection itself
    when there are no clients left.

  - Add support for monitoring how long the server has been online.

  - A GTK+ port, and an anygui port; Tk is not that attractive on
    Linux.

  - Improve support for trapping exceptions (e.g. missing config files
    aren't trapped properly yet).
