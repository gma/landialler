TODO
----

Prioritised list of things to do:

  - Re-write server with unit test coverage (in progress).

  - Add logging support to server via Python's logging API.

  - Replace server's Makefile with distutils.

  - Improve support for trapping common errors (e.g. missing
    config files aren't trapped properly yet).

  - Build gentoo packages.
