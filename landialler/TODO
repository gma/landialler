TODO
----

Things to be done, in no particular order:

  - Modify landialler to make sure that exceptions are trapped
    properly and a dialog is displayed to the user.

  - Stop xmlrpcserver from writing to syslog all the time.

  - Rename classes in views.py by placing "Abstract" on the front of each.

  - Refactor the window/dialog classes so that they inherit from the
    toolkit's windows, instead of having self.window attributes.

  - Add support to the client for detecting time outs, allowing the
    client to retry the connection from scratch, with a retry/cancel
    dialog. Should this really go in the server and API?

  - Put retry/cancel buttons on the dropped connection dialog, instead
    of just OK.

  - Add support for monitoring how long the server has been online.

  - A ButtonBar class for creating and drawing rows of one or more button.

  - A GTK+ port, and an anygui port; Tk is not that attractive on
    Linux.

  - Improve support for trapping common exceptions (e.g. missing
    config files aren't trapped properly yet).

  - Add a destroy_cb attribute to a Window that can be called when the
    window is destroyed? Might be a good idea, but need to think about
    how it would get set and how it would be run (e.g. where it would
    be run from).
