TODO
----

The following updates should make it into release 0.2 proper:

  - Handle two client's trying to start the connection at the same
    time more gracefully.

  - Add an Observer class and make View and Controller inherit from it.

  - Add views.Dialog and get tkviews.Dialog to inherit from it, making
    cleanup() an abstract method of views.Dialog. Move all occurrences
    of the modal attribute into views.py.

  - Add support to the client for detecting time outs, allowing the
    client to retry the connection from scratch, with a retry/cancel
    dialog.

  - Stop xmlrpcserver from writing to syslog all the time.

These changes will come along later, probably for the 1.0 release.

  - Add retry/cancel dialog if the connection drops out.

  - Add support for monitoring how long the server has been online.

  - A GTK+ port, and an anygui port; Tk is not that attractive on
    Linux.

  - Improve support for trapping exceptions (e.g. missing config files
    aren't trapped properly yet).
