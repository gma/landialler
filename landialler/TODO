TODO
----

Prioritised list of things to do:

  - Unit test coverage (in progress).

  - Port XML-RPC code to later versions of Python.

  - Replace server's Makefile with distutils.

  - Merge useful parts of gmalib into landialler, use Python's new
    logging API.

  - Write a client in another language.

  - Display how long the server has been online.

  - Put retry/cancel buttons on the dropped connection dialog.

  - Add support to the client for detecting time outs, allowing the
    client to retry the connection from scratch, with a retry/cancel
    dialog. Should this really go in the server and API?

  - Improve support for trapping common errors (e.g. missing
    config files aren't trapped properly yet).
