The following updates should make it into release 0.2 proper:

  - Stop xmlrpcserver from writing to syslog all the time.

These changes will come along later, probably for the 1.0 release.

  - Add support to the client for detecting time outs, allowing the
    client to retry the connection from scratch, with a retry/cancel
    dialog. Should this really go in the server and API?

  - Put retry/cancel buttons on the dropped connection dialog, instead
    of just OK.

  - Add support for monitoring how long the server has been online.

  - A ButtonBar class for creating and drawing rows of one or more button.

  - A GTK+ port, and an anygui port; Tk is not that attractive on
    Linux.

  - Improve support for trapping exceptions (e.g. missing config files
    aren't trapped properly yet).
