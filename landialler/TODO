TODO
----

Things to be done, in no particular order:

  - Add support for monitoring how long the server has been online.

  - Report the number of total bytes sent/received, and per client.

  - Add support to the client for detecting time outs, allowing the
    client to retry the connection from scratch, with a retry/cancel
    dialog. Should this really go in the server and API?

  - Put retry/cancel buttons on the dropped connection dialog, instead
    of just OK.

  - A ButtonBar class for creating and drawing rows of one or more button.

  - An anygui or PyQT port. How about a native Win32 version with
    Delphi?

  - Improve support for trapping common exceptions (e.g. missing
    config files aren't trapped properly yet).

  - Add a destroy_cb attribute to a Window that can be called when the
    window is destroyed? Might be a good idea, but need to think about
    how it would get set and how it would be run (e.g. where it would
    be run from).
