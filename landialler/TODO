This is release 0.2pre1. The following updates should make it into
release 0.2 proper:

  - Add timeout support to the client during connections.

  - Add retry/cancel dialog if the timeout is reached.

  - Handle two client's trying to start the connection at the same
    more gracefully.

These changes will come along later, probably for the 1.0 release.

  - Add retry/cancel dialog if the connection drops out.

  - Add a thread to the server to keep better track of the number of
    current users, so that the server can close the connection itself
    when there are no clients left.

  - Add support for monitoring how long the server has been online.

  - A GTK+ port, and an anygui port; Tk is not that attractive on
    Linux.

  - Improve support for trapping exceptions (e.g. missing config files
    aren't trapped properly yet).
