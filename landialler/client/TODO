This file documents upcoming fixes/things on my mind/stuff I'd like to
do, in no particular order.

  - Keep track of the number of clients that have requested
    connectivity so that the Net connection isn't dropped until the
    last landialler client has been closed.

  - Drastically improve the interface so that the user is provided
    with some proper feedback, both whilst the connection is being setup
    (i.e. the "Yes, I'm still alive, hang on" kind of thing), and
    whilst connected (e.g. "You've been connected for 23 mins, 2 people
    on line"). This will involve learning some Tk, as will making it
    possible to minimise the "Connected" dialog...

  - Find out why the tkMessageBox.askyesno() dialog box hangs around
    for ages after the user has pressed a button on Linux. Will, you
    guessed it, mean I need to find out a bit more about Tk... :(

  - A GTK+/GNOME port as Tk is *really* ugly on Linux. Perhaps I
    should do wxWindows() instead but I'd quite like to have a GNOME
    applet for this stuff.

  - Improve support for trapping exceptions (e.g. missing config files
    aren't trapped properly yet! - how embarrassing?).
