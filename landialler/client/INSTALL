INSTALL
-------

This file contains the installation instructions for landialler.py.
In the future they will be streamlined so that you will be able to
type something as simple as "python setup.py", but unfortunately we're
not quite there yet.


REQUIREMENTS

  - Any operating system that supports Python 2.1 and Tk
  - Python 2.1 with Tk support (may work with Python 2.0)
  - xmlrpclib, from http://www.pythonware.com/products/xmlrpc/
  - gmalib, available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/landialler/

If you want to use the GTK+ user interface (instead of Tk) then you will
also need the GTK+ libraries and the Python bindings:

  - GTK+ is available from http://www.gtk.org/
  - PyGTK is available from http://www.daa.com.au/~james/pygtk/

Installing GTK+ support is recommended if you are running on a Unix or
Linux platform as it makes things look much nicer. It behaves better too.
If PyGTK is installed correctly it will be used by default on Unix systems.


INSTALLATION

I will ignore the first two requirements; if you're not sure whether
or not you've got Python visit http://www.python.org/ and download the
latest version for your platform.

Now, download xmlrpclib from the URL above (xmlrpclib should be
included with the main Python source tree from Python 2.2 onwards, so
you may have it already). If not you will need to copy the
xmlrpclib.py file into your Python system directory (on Windows) or
into Python's site-packages directory (Unix).

Then install gmalib according to the instructions that come with it.

To install the client itself, follow the instructions for your
platform:

  Windows
    - Download the latest landialler ZIP file, and unzip into a temporary
      directory.

    - From within the landialler directory, run "python setup.py install"
      to install the landiallermvc package.

    - Create a landialler directory (e.g. C:\Program Files\landialler)
      and copy landialler.py and landialler.conf into the new directory.
      If you want to put the landialler.conf file in a different directory
      you may, but see the -c command line option notes below.

    - Right click the desktop to create a new shortcut and point
      it towards landialler.py. Make sure that the shortcut runs
      landialler in it's own directory.

      Note: If you'd like to avoid the console window that always pops
            up when you run landialler.py then rename landialler.py to
            landialler.pyw and use that instead.

  Unix (or Linux)
    - Simply type "python setup.py install" to have everything done for
      you.

      Note: landialler.py will be copied into /usr/local/bin
            landialler.conf will be copied into /usr/local/etc

      If you want to put the configuration file somewhere else you may,
      but see the -c command line option notes below.

    - If your system has Python support for GTK+ it will be used by default.
      If you'd prefer to use Tk instead you have two choices; 1) edit the
      /usr/local/etc/landialler.conf file, adding a section that looks
      like this:

        [interface]
        toolkit: tk

      or 2) run landialler with the "-u tk" command line switch. If you have
      any difficulty getting GTK+ support to work send me an email with a
      description of the problem and I'll see if I can help you to get it
      working.

  MacOS
    - I'm afraid I don't have access to a Mac and so have no idea how
      to install landialler. I'm not even sure if it works, but I'd be
      surprised if it didn't. If you let me know I'll gratefully
      include the information here though.


CONFIGURATION

You will probably need to edit the [xmlrpcserver] section of the
config file. Set the IP address of your landialler server in the
file. If you find that your Internet connection regularly takes more
than two minutes to come up then you can increase the timeout
parameter in the config file to suit (the default is 120 seconds).

Once landialler is installed properly you may find the following command
line options useful:

  -c file       specify an alternate configuration file
  -d            enable extra debugging output
  -u toolkit    select the GUI toolkit (tk, gtk)

If you have problems installing either the client or the server then I
will try and help you if I can. Please make sure that you send me as
much information as you can, including the operating system (and
version number) that you are using, the version of Python and any
output that you see when you launch the software (either on the
command line or in syslog).
