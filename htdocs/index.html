      <p>
	Welcome to the landialler project home page. Apologies for the
	lack of visual stimulation; so far I've been concentrating on
	landialler's portabiltiy instead of making this web page look
	gorgeous.
      </p>

      <a name="about"><h2>About</h2></a>
      <p>
	landialler enables several computers on a LAN (Local Area
	Network) to share control of a dial up connection to the
	Internet. To see if landialler would be useful to you, try
	answering these questions:
      </p>
      <ol>
	<li>
	  Do you have several computers at home? Can they be connected
	  together to form a small network?
	  <p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  Do you connect to the Internet intermittently (e.g. via a
	  phone line)?
	  <p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  Can you configure your network so that all your computers
	  can access the Internet at once? This is the trickiest bit,
	  but is well worth the effort. There are lots of instructions
	  available on how to set it up with Linux; see the <a
	  href="#further-reading">further reading</a> section for more
	  details.
	</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
	If you said <strong>yes</strong> (or nearly yes) to all or
	most of the above questions then (with a bit of tweaking)
	landialler will enable any of the computers on your home
	network to control your Internet connection.
      </p>
      <p>
	If you said <strong>no</strong> to all of them, then
	landialler is probably not going to be of much use to you.
      </p>

      <p>
	landialler comes in two parts:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  <strong>The client</strong><br>
	  The client is a small graphical application that is run on
	  a computer without a modem.
	  <p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <strong>The server</strong><br>

	  The server is a daemon program (i.e. it is always running)
	  that sits on the computer that has the modem, waiting for a
	  client to ask it to connect to the Internet. Currently, only
	  POSIX compliant operating systems (i.e. Unix) are
	  supported. If there is demand for Windows support then it
	  will be added in due course.
	</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
	The client and server are both written in <a
	href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> and communicate with
	each other using <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/">XML-RPC</a>.
      </p>

      <a name="screenshots"><h2>Screenshots</h2></a>
      <p>
	These screenshots were made on Windows, but the landialler
	client works equally well on Linux (though it has to be said
	it doesn't look very nice&nbsp;-&nbsp; the Tk GUI toolkit is
	not an attractive beast).
      </p>

      <table align="center" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="5">
	<tbody>
	  <tr>
	    <td>
	      <img alt="Go online dialog"
		   src="images/ss/go-online.gif" height="119"

	    </td>
	    <td>

	      </font>
	    </td>
	  </tr>
	</tbody>
      </table>

      <p>
	So what's happening here?
      </p>

      <ol>
	<li>
	  After "Yes" has been clicked on the first dialog the client
	  sends an XML-RPC message to the server, instructing the
	  modem to connect to the Internet. The server actually runs
	  an operating system dependent script, so landialler can be
	  easily configured to use different operating systems and
	  different dial up hardware and software.
	  <p>
	</li>

        <li>
	  Once the script has started and the server is dialling up,
	  the client continually asks the server for a progress
	  update. If the connection is made inside the (configurable)
	  time limit then the second dialog pops up. To close the
	  connection just click OK (yep, you're right - that button
	  should say "Disconnect", but I need to learn some Tk first).
	  <p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  Finally, if the time limit is hit before the connection has
	  been made successfully you get the option to try again. You
	  may want to tweak the time out value, which is easy because
	  it's stored in the landialler configuration file. The
	  default time limit for setting up a new connection is two
	  minutes.
	  <p>
	</li>
      </ol>

      <a name="download"><h2>Download</h2></a>

      <p>
	Both the client (called landialler) and the server (called
	landiallerd) are available from the SourceForge project
	page. You will also want to grab the gmalib.py library while
	you're there...
      </p>

      <p>
	To be able to run the landialler server you need a Unix box
	configured to do some sort of Network Address Translation
	(NAT) or <a
	href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/IP-Masquerade-HOWTO-2.html#ss2.1">IP
	Masquerading</a>. You can use any modern Unix system, so long
	as it can run Python 2.1 software. I use <a
	href="http://www.linux.com/">Linux</a>, so I've included
	information on that here. You could use any of the BSD
	variants (e.g. <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>,
	<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>, <a
	href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a>), <a
	href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/">Solaris</a>,
	etc. instead if you prefer.
      </p>
      <p>
	If it wasn't for the excellent documentation then setting it
	up would be quite a long and painful process for the
	uninitiated. First find out which version of the Linux kernel
	you are running	(type <kbd>uname&nbsp;-r</kbd>) and then follow the
	relevant links below.
