	    <strong>Python 2.3 and GTK2 port released shortly</strong>
	    (13 March 2004)<br/>
	      
	      It's taken longer than I'd hoped, but a new Python 2.3
	      compatible version of LANdialler is now available from <a
		href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=34228">CVS</a>
	      (scroll down to the "Anonymous CVS Access" section). I've
	      not made packages yet as there's quite a bit of work to do
	      on the installation and packaging, and it is not yet tested
	      on Windows. If you'd like to try it check it out from CVS
	      and run both the client and server from within their current
	      directories. I've uploaded a <a
		href="screenshots.html">screenshot</a> to tempt you into it.

	    <strong>Development back underway</strong> (18 January
	    2004)<br>

	    I've made very few changes to LANdialler for a long time
	    now, primarily because it just worked. However, it no
	    longer works out of the box with the later versions of
	    Python due to the absorption of the XML-RPC module into
	    the Python standard library. This is the first thing that
	    will be fixed.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    I'm also intending to port the Unix GUI to GTK2, a change 
	    which is long over due. For a full list of what's coming see
	    the <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/landialler/landialler/TODO">TODO</a> 
	    list.

      <h1>Feedback</h1>
            
      <p>
	If you find LANdialler useful, have some suggestons for
	possible new features, or just can't make it work, I'd love to
	hear about it. Please either drop into the <a
	href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=106888">forum</a>,
	add a <a
	href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=410222&group_id=34228&func=browse"
	>feature request</a> or simply 
	<a href="http://sourceforge.net/users/ashtong/">email me</a>.
