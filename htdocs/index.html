	    <strong>Python 2.3 and GTK2 port released shortly</strong>
	    (13 March 2004)<br/>

	    It's taken longer than I'd hoped, but a new Python 2.3
	    compatible version of LANdialler is now available from <a
	    href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=34228">CVS</a>
	    (scroll down to the "Anonymous CVS Access" section). I've
	    not made packages yet as there's quite a bit of work to do
	    on the installation and packaging, and it as yet untested
	    on Windows. If you'd like to try it check out the head of
	    CVS and run both the client and server from within their
	    current directories. I've uploaded a <a
	    href="screenshots.html">screenshot</a> to tempt you into
	    it.

	    <strong>Development back underway</strong> (18 January
	    2004)<br> I've made very few changes to LANdialler for a
	    long time now, primarily because it just worked. However,
	    it no longer works out of the box with the later versions
	    of Python due to the absorption of the XML-RPC module into
	    the Python standard library. This is the first thing that
	    will be fixed. <strong>Note: The instructions below refer to 
	    running LANdialler with Python 2.1. If you want to use a 
	    later version of Python please wait a week or two until the 
	    new version is ready.</strong>
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    I'm also intending to port the Unix GUI to GTK2, a change 
	    which is long over due. For a full list of what's coming see
	    the <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/landialler/landialler/TODO">TODO</a>

      <p>
	LANdialler enables several computers on a LAN (Local Area
	Network) to share control of a dial up connection to the
	Internet.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	If you have a small home or office network (a LAN) that
	connects to the Internet via a dial up link on a Linux
	computer, then LANdialler could be of real use to you. If you
	haven't got a Linux router yet find out how to <a
	href="routing-docs.html">set one up</a>. The LANdialler client
	software should run on most operating systems, including
	Windows and Linux.
      </p>

      <p>
	LANdialler is released under the terms of the <a
	href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt">GNU General Public
	License</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
            
      <p>
	LANdialler consists of two programs:
      </p>

      <ul>
	<li>
	  <strong>The client</strong> is run on all desktop computers
	  that require Internet access. It talks to the server,
	  requesting Internet connectivity for as long as the user
	  requires it. The interface is very simple, which is
	  officially a "good thing".
	  <p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <strong>The server</strong> runs on the Linux router and
	  manages the state of the dial up connection. It keeps track
	  of the number of people who have asked to go online and
	  keeps the Internet connection up until the last user
	  disconnects.
	</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>
	Because the dial up connection is handled by your Linux router
	your desktop computers can remain safely protected from prying
	eyes by your router's firewall (assuming you have configured
	it&nbsp;-&nbsp;if not why not?).
      </p>
            
      <p>
	The client and server communicate with one another over the
	local network through the <a
	href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/">XML-RPC</a> protocol.
      </p>

      <a name="download"></a>
      <h1>Download</h1>

      <p>
	The latest versions of LANdialler are always available from
	the <a
	href="http://sf.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=34228">project
	files</a> page. You should download the latest versions of all
	three packages.  Installation instructions are included with
	the source code.
      </p>

      <h2>Requirements</h2>

      <p>
	Both the client and server are written in the <a
	href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> programming
	language. Please make sure that you have a recent version (2.1
	or later) installed. You can <a
	href="http://www.python.org/download/">download it</a> for
	free.
      </p>
            
      <p>
	The client should run on any operating system with Python and
	Tk support&nbsp;-&nbsp;it has been tested on both Windows and
	<a href="http://www.linux.com/">Linux</a>.
      </p>
            
      <p>
	The server should run on any POSIX compliant operating system,
	but has only been tested on Debian GNU/Linux v2.2. You could
	use any of the BSD variants (e.g. <a
	href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>, <a
	href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>, <a
	href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a>) or <a
	href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/">Solaris</a>,
	etc. instead if you prefer (success reports would be very
	welcome). Just make sure you can configure it to route IP
	packets between your network and the Internet.  There is lots
	of <a href="routing-docs.html">documentation</a> available for
	Linux if you're not sure how to set it up.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	Both the client and the server require PythonWare's <a
	href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/xmlrpc/">xmlrpclib</a>
	library.
      </p>
