	      LANdialler enables several computers on a LAN (Local
	      Area Network) to share control of a dial up connection
	      to the Internet.
	    </p>
	    <ol>
	      <li>
		Do you have several computers at home? Can they be
		connected together to form a small network?
		<p>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		Would you like all your computers to be able to share
		the same modem, controlling it as if they were
		connected directly to it?
		<p>
	      </li>
	    </ol>

	    <p>
	      If so, you'll probably be interested in LANdialler.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      If you said <strong>no</strong> to all of them, then
	      LANdialler is probably not going to be of much use to you.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      LANdialler comes in two parts:
	    </p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>
		<strong>The client</strong><br>
		The client is a small graphical application that is run on
		a computer without a modem.
		<p>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<strong>The server</strong><br>

		The server is a daemon program (i.e. it is always
		running) that sits on the computer that has the modem,
		waiting for a client to ask it to connect to the
		Internet. Currently, only POSIX compliant operating
		systems (i.e. Unix) are supported. If there is demand
		for Windows support then it will be added in due
		course.
	      </li>
	    </ul>

	    <p>
	      The client and server are both written in <a
	      href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> and communicate
	      with each other using <a
	      href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/">XML-RPC</a>.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      So what's happening here?
	    </p>

	    <ol>
	      <li>
		After "Yes" has been clicked on the first dialog the
		client sends an XML-RPC message to the server,
		instructing the modem to connect to the Internet. The
		server actually runs an operating system dependent
		script, so LANdialler can be easily configured to use
		different operating systems and different dial up
		hardware and software.
		<p>
	      </li>

	      <li>
		Once the script has started and the server is dialling
		up, the client continually asks the server for a
		progress update. If the connection is made inside the
		(configurable) time limit then the second dialog pops
		up. To close the connection just click OK (yep, you're
		right - that button should say "Disconnect", but I
		need to learn some Tk first).
		<p>
	      </li>
	      
	      <li>
		Finally, if the time limit is hit before the
		connection has been made successfully you get the
		option to try again. You may want to tweak the time
		out value, which is easy because it's stored in the
		LANdialler configuration file. The default time limit
		for setting up a new connection is two minutes.
		<p>
	      </li>
	    </ol>

	    <a name="download"><h2>Download</h2></a>

	    <p>
	      Both the client (called landialler) and the server
	      (called landiallerd) are available from the SourceForge
	      project page. You will also want to grab the gmalib.py
	      library while you're there...
	    </p>

	    <p align="center">
	      <a

		from SourceForge</a>

	    <p>
	      To be able to run the LANdialler server you need a Unix
	      box configured to do some sort of Network Address
	      Translation (NAT) or <a
	      href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/IP-Masquerade-HOWTO-2.html#ss2.1">IP
	      Masquerading</a>. You can use any modern Unix system, so
	      long as it can run Python 2.1 software. I use <a
	      href="http://www.linux.com/">Linux</a>, so I've included
	      information on that here. You could use any of the BSD
	      variants (e.g. <a
	      href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>, <a
	      href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>, <a
	      href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a>), <a
	      href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/">Solaris</a>,
	      etc. instead if you prefer.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      If it wasn't for the excellent documentation then
	      setting it up would be quite a long and painful process
	      for the uninitiated. First find out which version of the
	      Linux kernel you are running (type
	      <kbd>uname&nbsp;-r</kbd>) and then follow the relevant
	      links below.
	    </p>
