      <h1>What is LANdialler?</h1>

      <p>
	LANdialler enables several computers on a LAN (Local Area
	Network) to share control of a dial up connection to the
	Internet.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	If you have a small home or office network (a LAN) that
	connects to the Internet via a dial up link on a Linux
	computer, then LANdialler could be of real use to you. If you
	haven't got a Linux router yet find out how to <a
	href="routing-docs.html">set one up</a>. The LANdialler client
	software should run on most operating systems, including
	Windows and Linux.
      </p>

      <p>
	LANdialler is released under the terms of the <a
	href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt">GNU General Public
	License</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
            
      <p>
	LANdialler consists of two programs:
      </p>

      <ul>
	<li>
	  <strong>The client</strong> is run on all desktop computers
	  that require Internet access. It talks to the server,
	  requesting Internet connectivity for as long as the user
	  requires it. The interface is very simple, which is
	  officially a "good thing".
	  <p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <strong>The server</strong> runs on the router and manages
	  the state of the dial up connection. It keeps track of the
	  number of people who have asked to go online and keeps the
	  Internet connection up until the last user disconnects.
	</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>
	Because the dial up connection is handled by your Linux router
	your desktop computers can remain safely protected from prying
	eyes by your router's firewall (assuming you have configured
	it&nbsp;-&nbsp;if not why not?).
      </p>
            
      <p>
	The client and server communicate with one another over the
	local network through the <a
	href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/">XML-RPC</a> protocol.
      </p>
