      <p>
	Welcome to the landialler project home page. Apologies for the
	lack of visual stimulation; so far I've been concentrating on
	landialler's portabiltiy instead of making this web page look
	gorgeous.
      </p>

      <a name="about"><h2>About</h2></a>
      <p>
	landialler enables several computers on a LAN (Local Area
	Network) to share control of a dial up connection to the
	Internet. To see if landialler would be useful to you, answer
	these questions:
      </p>
      <ol>
	<li>
	  Do you have several computers at home, connected together in
	  a small network?
	  <p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  Do you connect to the Internet intermittently (rather than
	  being permanently connected)?
	  <p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  Can you configure your network so that all your computers
	  can access the Internet at once? This is the trickiest bit,
	  but is well worth the effort. There are lots of instructions
	  on how to <a href="#further-reading">set it up</a> with
	  Linux.
	</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
	<strong>If you said no</strong> to any of the above questions
	then landialler is probably not going to be of much use to
	you.
      </p>
      <p>
	<strong>If you said yes</strong> (or nearly yes) to all of
	them, then landialler will enable any of the computers on your
	home network to control your Internet connection.
      </p>

      <p>
	landialler comes in two parts:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  <strong>The client</strong><br>
	  The client is a small graphical application that is run on
	  a computer without a modem.
	  <p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <strong>The server</strong><br>

	  The server is a daemon program (i.e. it is always running)
	  that sits on the computer that has the modem, waiting for a
	  client to ask it to connect to the Internet. Currently, only
	  POSIX compliant operating systems (i.e. Unix) are
	  supported. If there is demand for Windows support then it
	  will be added in due course.
	</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
	The client and server are both written in <a
	href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> and communicate with
	each other using <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/">XML-RPC</a>.
      </p>

      <a name="screenshots"><h2>Screenshots</h2></a>
      <p>
	These screenshots were made on Windows, but the landialler
	client works equally well on Linux (though it has to be said
	it doesn't look very nice&nbsp;-&nbsp; the Tk GUI toolkit is
	not an attractive beast).
      </p>

      <table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="2" width="100%">
	<tbody>
	  <tr>
	    <td>
	      <font size="-2">
		<strong>Are you sure now?</strong>
	      </font>
	    </td>
	    <td>
	      <font size="-2">
		<strong>Success!</strong>
	      </font>
	    </td>
	    <td>
	      <font size="-2">
		<strong>Ahh, go on go on go on, you will...</strong>
	      </font>
	    </td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>
	      <img alt="Go online dialog"
		   src="images/ss/go-online.gif" height="119" width="209">
	    </td>

	      <img alt="Click to disconnect dialog"

	      <img alt="Click to disconnect dialog"

	    </td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	  </tr>
	</tbody>
      </table>

      <p>
	After "Yes" has been clicked on the first dialog the client
	sends an XML-RPC message to the server, instructing the modem
	to connect to the Internet. The server actually runs an
	operating system dependent script, so landialler can be easily
	configured to use different operating systems and different
	sort of dial up techniques.
      </p>

      <p>
	Once the script has started and the server is dialling up, the
	client continually asks the server for an progress update. If
	the connection is made inside the (configurable) time limit
	then the second dialog pops up. To close the connection just
	click OK (yep, you're right - that button should say
	"Disconnect", but I need to learn some Tk first).
      </p>

      <p>
	Finally, if the connection timed out you get the option to try
	again. You may want to tweak the time out value, which is easy
	because it's stored in the landialler configuration file. The
	default time out is two minutes, as that's what the author
	finds works rather well on his modem, with his ISP.
      </p>

      <p>
	Ah, now there you've got me. It's all working perfectly well
	at the moment but I haven't quite finished packaging it up
	yet. If you want to know when it is first available you can
	subscribe to the <a href=
	"http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/landialler-announce">mailing
	list</a> as I'll be posting an announcement there (probably
	before the end of August 2001).
      </p>

      <p>
	As soon as the first landialler snapshots are available they
	will be available direct from the <a
	href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/landialler/">SourceForge
	project page</a>.
      </p>

      <a name="further-reading"><h2>Further Reading</h2></a>

      <p>
	I'll be posting some links to documenation on how to configure
	a Linux box to route packets between a private LAN and the
	Internet here soon.
