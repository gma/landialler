    <strong>LANdialler 0.2pre releases</strong> (1 November 2001)<br/>
    The whole system has had a complete overhaul, including full
    multi-user support and a fully re-designed user interface. Plugins
    for other GUI toolkits are now possible - GTK+ is already under
    way.

    If you've got version 0.2 we strongly recommend that you upgrade.
