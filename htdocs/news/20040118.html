	    <strong>Development back underway</strong> (18 January
	    2004)<br>

	    I've made very few changes to LANdialler for a long time
	    now, primarily because it just worked. However, it no
	    longer works out of the box with the later versions of
	    Python due to the absorption of the XML-RPC module into
	    the Python standard library. This is the first thing that
	    will be fixed.

	    I'm also intending to port the Unix GUI to GTK2, a change 
	    which is long over due. For a full list of what's coming see
	    the <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/landialler/landialler/TODO">TODO</a> 
	    list.
