	    <strong>Python 2.3 and GTK2 port released shortly</strong>
	    (13 March 2004)<br/>
	      
	      It's taken longer than I'd hoped, but a new Python 2.3
	      compatible version of LANdialler is now available from <a
		href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=34228">CVS</a>
	      (scroll down to the "Anonymous CVS Access" section). I've
	      not made packages yet as there's quite a bit of work to do
	      on the installation and packaging, and it is not yet tested
	      on Windows. If you'd like to try it check it out from CVS
	      and run both the client and server from within their current
	      directories. I've uploaded a <a
		href="screenshots.html">screenshot</a> to tempt you into it.
