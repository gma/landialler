      <p>
	The latest version of the LANdialler client and server is
	currently <strong>only available from <a
	href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=34228">CVS</a></strong>.
	It uses GTK2 and has (so far) only been tested on Linux. It
	works very well, but there are a couple of minor bugs to be
	flattened before version 0.3 is packaged. If you'd like to try
	it check it out and run the client and server from within the
	checked out directory.
      </p>

      <p>
	Older (and fully tested) versions of LANdialler are still
	available from the <a
	href="http://sf.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=34228">project
	files</a> page. Note that they have been written to work with
	Python 2.1, GTK1 and Tk, and have not been successfully tested
	with Python 2.3. Installation instructions are included with
	the source code.
      </p>

      <h2>Requirements</h2>

      <ul>
	<li>
	  <a href="http://www.python.org/2.3/">Python</a> (2.3 or later)
	</li>
	<li>
	  <a href="http://www.gtk.org/download/">GTK+</a> (2.0 or later)
	</li>
	<li>
	  <a href="http://pygtk.org/downloads.html">PyGTK</a>
	</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
	The client should run on any operating system with Python and
	GTK/PyGTK support&nbsp;-&nbsp;it has been tested on both Windows
	and <a href="http://www.linux.com/">Linux</a>.
      </p>
            
      <p>
	The server should run on any POSIX compliant operating system,
	but has only been tested on Linux. You could use any of the
	BSD variants (e.g.&nbsp;<a
	href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>, <a
	href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>, <a
	href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a>) or <a
	href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/">Solaris</a>,
	etc. if you prefer (success reports would be very
	welcome). Just make sure you can configure it to route IP
	packets between your network and the Internet.  
      </p>

      <p>
	There is lots of <a href="routing-docs.html">documentation</a>
	available for Linux if you're not sure how to set it up.
